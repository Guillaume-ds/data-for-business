    "A convolutional neural network is a neural network that uses convolution instead of matrix product. Convolution consists in applying the same transformation to different parts of the image, that will reflect the dependence between pixels and thus will detect the main features of the image. With convolution, the inputs are not connected to every neurons, but instead they are linked to their neighbours. This is a sparse connectivity, as opposed to the dense connectivity of a traditionnal neural network, wich are easier to optimize. \n",
